<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Code verifier <a name="about-project"></a>

> In construction........

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

> I use node for the main construction of the RestApi and typescript for the main lenguage.
> Jest is used for the unit test suit.

## All dependencies installed:

- Express: It's a layer built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage servers and routes.
- Dotenv: Is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into 'process.env'.
- Jest: Unit test suit for javascript.
- Nodemon: Is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
- Typescript: TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.
- Serve: serve helps you serve a static site, single page application or just a static file (no matter if on your device or on the local network). It also provides a neat interface for listing the directory's contents.
- Webpack: Its main purpose is to bulndle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
- SuperTest: this dependency helps to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.
- Eslint: ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Scripts:

>tsconfig.json file is created.
```sh
  npm run build
```

>dist folder with it's production index.js file are created.
```sh
  npm run start
```

>We enter in developer mode where we can see all our changes made when refreshing the browser with no need of restart the server.
```sh
  npm run dev
```

>We run our tests.
```sh
  npm run test
```

>We run our tests and also run our coverage HTML file.
```sh
  npm run serve:coverage
```

## Environment variable:
>Inside your .env file you should create:
```sh
  PORT=8000
```
